- 👋 Hi, I’m @gyap-proj
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to deploy and apply computer science concepts to create more efficient processes in business. (But haven't applied
- much of what I've learned yet unfortunately).
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms for technical interviews and plan to post what problems I've solved and eventaully add 
- in time and space complexity analysis and slowly add in machine learning and sql courses I'm currently looking at.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects surrounding the topics of machine learning and artificial concepts (even if I currently may 
- not be able to contribute much) to get more acquainted with the topic to deploy a project myself.
